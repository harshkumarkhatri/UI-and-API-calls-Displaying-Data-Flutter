# ui_and_api_calls_to_display_data_in_gridview
This is an app which i build watching a video on youtube.<br>
**About the App**<br>
This app has a grid screen that displays the text and images which are received from an API call. Apart from the title and images the thumbnail URL and the image URL are also received which are then displayed in a good format on the screen. <br>
After the home screen which is the screen i have talked about above, when we click on any of the image thumbnails, the full image is displayed with an x. The full image is there for you to have a good look at the image. When you click on the x, the image closes and we are sent back to the home i.e. gridview screen.<br>
Things which are done in the app:
* MaterialApp class/design.
* Scaffold Class.
* AppBar.
* Use of functions and variables.
* Stateless and Stateful widget.
* Api call.
* Displaying JSOn output in good form.
* Gridview.
